# Personal-Framework
Personal Framework project

This is a fun project of myself to try and learn making my own framework.
Most is the code is explained in Dutch, because mainly fellow students can look into this then to solve their own problems.

DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION as I am not a specialist in security!
